\title{Leaflet Plot of a Wind Park}
\usage{
leafPlot(result, Polygon1, which = 1, orderitems = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{result}{The resulting matrix of the function 'genAlgo' or
'windfarmGA'. (matrix)}

\item{Polygon1}{The Polygon for the wind farm area. (SpatialPolygons)}

\item{which}{A numeric value, indicating which best indidvual to plot.
The default is 1 (the best resulting wind farm). (numeric)}

\item{orderitems}{A logical value indicating whether the results should
be ordered by energy values (TRUE) or chronologically (FALSE). (logical)}
}
\value{
Returns a leaflet map. (leaflet)
}
\description{
Plot a resulting wind farm on a leaflet map.

\examples{
\donttest{
load(file = system.file("extdata/resulthex.rda", package = "windfarmGA"))
load(file = system.file("extdata/polygon.rda", package = "windfarmGA"))

## Plot the best wind farm on a leaflet map (ordered by energy values)
leafPlot(result = resulthex, Polygon1 = polygon, which = 1)

## Plot the last wind farm (ordered by chronology).
leafPlot(result = resulthex, Polygon1 = polygon, orderitems = F,
         which = 1)
